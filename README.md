# ISE Proximity Tracking Android App Development Guide

Development guide for building a proximity tracking application using Java and Android Studio for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Industrial and Systems Engineering department. The maintenance and proximity sensing (MAPS) project a tool to be developed that continuously throughout the day tracks the proximity of two subjects in an indoor space and reports the data to the research team. The current solution using custom hardware is expensive and infeasible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This solution would allow for design, development, and deployment in a more efficient, cost effective and safe manner.
